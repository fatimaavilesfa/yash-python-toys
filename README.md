# Yash Toys!

This is a repo of Python toy problems for Yashwanth Nandanam and I to play with Python syntax and build mastery over the language.

Simple problems that only require a knowledge of Python syntax are stored in /syntax/, but more advanced problems
will be stored in directories relating to mastery of Python libraries and system scripting.
